    **Understanding the Mortgage Amortization Schedule:**
    * **Loan Amount:** The initial principal borrowed.
    * **Annual Interest Rate:** The stated yearly interest rate of the mortgage.
    * **Loan Term in Years:** The total duration over which the loan is repaid.
    * **Payment Frequency:** How often payments are made (e.g., Monthly = 12 times a year).
    * **Calculated Monthly Payment:** The fixed amount you pay each period, calculated to fully amortize the loan over its term.
    * **Beginning Balance:** The outstanding principal balance at the start of a payment period.
    * **Interest Paid:** The portion of your monthly payment that goes towards paying the interest on the outstanding balance. Calculated as `Beginning Balance * (Annual Interest Rate / Payment Frequency)`.
    * **Principal Paid:** The portion of your monthly payment that reduces the outstanding principal balance. Calculated as `Monthly Payment - Interest Paid`.
    * **Ending Balance:** The remaining principal balance after the payment. Calculated as `Beginning Balance - Principal Paid`. This should reach $0 at the end of the loan term.

    **Key Takeaways from Visualizations:**
    * **Outstanding Loan Balance Over Time:** Illustrates how the principal balance decreases over the loan's life.
    * **Total Principal vs. Total Interest Paid:** This comparison clearly shows the total amount of principal repaid versus the total interest paid over the entire loan term. You'll typically pay significantly more interest in the early years of a mortgage. A shorter loan term often results in substantially less total interest paid, even if the monthly payments are higher.
